# QR code Scanner
 QR Code scanner app created by Johnny


QR code scanner app created using NodeJS, ExpressJS, and dockerized for deployment onto any platform u want. Tested deployment onto localhost and works very well and fast. Try it yourself by downloading docker then cloning my Docker image and running "docker run -p 3000:3000 my-qr-code-scanner-app" :).
